# ROT13
<b>Simple implementation of ROT13 algorithm in java.</b>
<br></br>
I've used JavaFX to create GUI.
<br></br>
This application has two work modes:
<ul>
  <li>Input text</li>
  <p>User enters text into text area and then do <b>encryption/decryption</b></p>
  <li>Select text file</li>
  <p>User selects file from his computer and then does <b>encryption/decryption</b></p>
</ul>

<p>Conversion is based on the type of input data, if it's already encrypted using ROT13 then it's going to decrypt data and vice versa</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add combo box for shift selection &#9989;</li>
  <li>Implement brute-force option &#9989;</li>
  <li>Implement brute-force method which uses shift from combo box</li>
  <li>Redesign GUI</li>
</ul>
