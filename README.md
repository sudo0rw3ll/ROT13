# ROT13
<b>Simple implementation of ROT13 algorithm in java.</b>
<br></br>
I've used JavaFX to create GUI.
<br></br>
This application has two work modes:
<ul>
  <li>Input text</li>
  <p>User enters text into text area and then do <b>encryption/decryption</b></p>
  <li>Select text file</li>
  <p>User selects file from his computer and then does <b>encryption/decryption</b></p>
</ul>
  I'm going to add combo box with different shifts for ROT, and hopefully <b>redesign</b> GUI
